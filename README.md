# Verbwire Wallet Integration

Welcome to the Verbwire Wallet Integration project! This repository demonstrates a basic workflow for integrating the Verbwire wallet into your app, providing a seamless user onboarding experience and smoother interactions with your decentralized application (dApp). The wallet can be utilized like any other wallet, allowing you to perform tasks such as signing messages, conducting transactions, managing NFTs, handling ERC-20 Tokens, and interacting with smart contracts.

## Basic Functions Demonstrated

This project showcases the following three fundamental functions:

1. **Signing a Message**: Demonstrates how to sign a message using the Verbwire wallet.

2. **Sending Funds**: Illustrates the process of sending an amount to another wallet address using the Verbwire wallet.

3. **Minting NFT (or Contract Interaction)**: Provides an example of minting an NFT or interacting with a smart contract using the Verbwire wallet.
